title: Hello World? 35th of May
---

Forget to pay for GoDaddy, Wordpress Blog has been shut down, luckily find github page, another perfect place to blog and blablabla.

I used to memorize this very date every year and call it 35th of May, although the feeling about this date become more complex recently, it's always good to remember the important things and move forward.
