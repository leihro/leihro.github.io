title: trust in God is the only solution
---

### what matters most
not genius, not education, not money, not anything you don't 'deserve' to possess,
cause God loves us and only gives us what we could possiblly take.
It's persistence and determination that matter, that make every one of us unique,

### bad experience home
home can not possiblly always be so sweat as childhood memory, it's normal to have bad experiences,
whether it was meant to be or what, it happened, now it's time to find a way out and move on.
hopefully it works, 

### no Doubt
It's not a shame to be beaten down or be humiliatied, man is good at forgeting things and 
modifying memories, what should be ashame of is getting lost and questioning God's plan,
let the ego makes decisions and not trust God anymore, that's why man lost the ultimate Power and 
that is really a disaster. Without God's help, it's hell even though in Heaven.
