title: trust in God is the only solution
---

### feel lost && get frustrated
never lived for me myself, always try to make others happy, 
never gonna know how much time really left for myself, 
but when others not understanding or being means, it's really hard to live with that.

### trust God
I choose to trust God, you are my last insurance, dispite how argliness my intension ist, you are my last hope,
it should have been a good day, it's just so hard to believe that I doubt myself,
meaningless godness that embarrase you or another test to make you stronger.
